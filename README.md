## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.13** with FastAPI and async/await
- **Alpine Linux 3.x** container base (reduced attack surface)
- **OpenSSL 3.x** for modern cryptography
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** with Alembic migrations
- **Go 1.23** stats service for real-time metrics streaming

### Frontend
- **React 18.3** with TypeScript (strict mode, zero `any`)
- **Vite** for fast development builds
- **TanStack Table** for data tables
- **React Grid Layout** for dashboard customization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Infrastructure
- **Multi-stage Docker build** - Go stats + React frontend + Python backend
- **Supervisor** for process management
- **Nginx** reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **Health checks** for all services

## Upgrading from v1 to v2

### Breaking Changes
- **Alert Rules**: Old alert rules must be recreated using the new alert system
- **mTLS Certificates**: Regenerate certificates due to Alpine's stricter OpenSSL 3.x requirements
- **Database Schema**: Automatic one-time migration from v1.1.3 to v2.0.0

### Data Preserved
- ✅ Hosts and their configurations
- ✅ Containers and container history
- ✅ Event logs and audit trail
- ✅ User accounts and preferences

### Post-Upgrade Steps
1. Regenerate mTLS certificates for remote hosts (see [mTLS Setup Guide](https://github.com/darthnorse/dockmon/wiki/Security-Guide#mtls-setup))
2. Recreate alert rules using the new alert system
3. Verify host connections after upgrade
